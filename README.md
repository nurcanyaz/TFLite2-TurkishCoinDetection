# TFLite2-TurkishCoinDetection
TFLite2-TurkishCoinDetection is an artificial intelligence model that identifies Turkish Lira coins using image processing and machine learning techniques. This project offers a lightweight and efficient classification model optimized with TensorFlow Lite for deployment on mobile and embedded devices.

# Features
 Recognition of Turkish Lira Coins: The model classifies 1 TL, 50 kuru≈ü, and other Turkish Lira coins based on their images.

Mobile and Embedded Device Integration: With the benefits of TensorFlow Lite, the model can operate quickly and efficiently on low-resource devices.

# Ease of Use
The project provides a clear structure with step-by-step explanations for training and testing processes.

# Technologies Used
- TensorFlow Lite: For model optimization and adaptation for mobile devices.
- Python: For data processing, model training, and testing.
- OpenCV: For image processing and data preprocessing.
# Project Structure
- coin_model.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the model training and conversion processes.
- images.zip: A dataset of coin images used for training and testing.
- README.md: A detailed description of the project.

Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite
- OpenCV


# Training and Testing the Model
- Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the coin_model.ipynb file.
- Once training is complete, the TensorFlow Lite model will be generated and ready for use.

# Example Usage
Integrate the trained model into a mobile application to perform coin recognition using live camera feeds.

# Future Work
- Enhance model performance with a more extensive and diverse dataset.
- Optimize for real-time recognition capabilities.
- Expand the model to recognize coins from different countries.
